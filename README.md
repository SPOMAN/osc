# osctools: Tools for the Organic Surface Chemistry group

This R package contains/will contain a set of useful tools for students and researchers at the [Organic Surface Chemistry](http://surfchem.dk) group at Aarhus University, Denmark. The package is under development, and probably will be for some time. Check the topics below to get an overview of what has been implemented so far. If you are missing features, then go ahead and create [an issue](https://github.com/SPOMAN/osc/issues).

The functions should be properly documented, so try `?function_name` in the R console if you have questions about function parameters. More general introduction and usage examples will be made available in the [oscbook](https://spoman.github.io/oscbook/).

We are preparing the initial version of `osctools` for release. The intention is to have the following features implemented.

**Electrochemistry** | CV | |
 | Electrolysis | |
**Raman spectroscopy** | Spectra | |
 | Spectra + curve fits | |
